## Features:
Our web application is designed for users who are interest in discovering extra knowledge about league of legends champions, which are the characters in the game, and professional players. The page shows the detailed stats of all the champions and allows users to compare up to 4 characters(lvl 1 stats and calculated lvl 18 stats). You can search for champions using their name. It also allows users to discover all the professional players of this game and their basic information such as name, team, hometown, etc. There is a tab on the left of the professional players view that allows users to choose players with which role they want to see(Top, Mid, ADC, Jungle, Support). This can work together with player search to show the players with specific characters in their name and with the specific role.
